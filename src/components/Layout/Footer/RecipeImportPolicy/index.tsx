      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        We understand that copyright is an important issue for recipe creators, bloggers, and users alike ‚Äî so we want to clarify
        exactly how Healthy Kitchen&rsquo;s Import Recipe feature works, and why using it to save and organize recipes does{' '}

      <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-2 mb-2">
        ü•Ñ Healthy Kitchen is a Smarter Way to Save Your Favorite Recipes
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        At its core, the Healthy Kitchen app is a tool for meal planning, recipe organization, and healthy eating.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        The Import Recipe feature lets users save recipes they love ‚Äî whether that&rsquo;s a family favorite, something they found
        on Instagram, or a recipe from their go-to food blog.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        Think of it like writing a recipe down in a notebook or bookmarking a webpage. It&rsquo;s for{' '}
        <span className="font-semibold">personal use only</span>, and everything is tied to the individual&rsquo;s private account.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        Most people already copy/paste recipes into Notes, Google Docs, or screenshot them into homemade iPhone folders. This just
        gives users a cleaner, more useful way to stay organized.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-6 border-black" />

      {/* No Bots */}
      <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-2 mb-2">‚úã No Bots, No Scraping</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        Recipes are saved manually, one at a time, by the user. Healthy Kitchen <span className="font-semibold">does not</span> use
        bots or scrapers to collect recipes from other websites.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">Only the user can decide what they want to save to their private account.</p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
        <li>We do <span className="font-semibold">not</span> recommend or promote specific recipes from external sources.</li>
        <li>We do <span className="font-semibold">not</span> store imported recipes in our public recipe database.</li>
        <li>We do <span className="font-semibold">not</span> publish outside recipes to our platform.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        Our in-app recipe catalog which is available to all users is completely separate and made by our own team. Again, if a user
        imports a recipe, that is only saved to their private &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; recipe profile.
      </p>

      {/* Note-taking analogy */}
      <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-2 mb-2">üìî Similar to Note‚ÄëTaking and Clipping Tools</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        The Import feature works a lot like tools such as Evernote, Notion, ReciMe, Pocket, Paprika, or Recipe Keeper, all of which
        allow users to save web content for their own private use.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        Just like saving a recipe into Google Docs or bookmarking it for later, Healthy Kitchen gives users a central place to
        organize their favorite meals for easier meal planning and grocery shopping.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-6 border-black" />

      <p className="mb-2 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        When a user imports a recipe, it&rsquo;s saved <span className="font-semibold">only</span> to their private account.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2 text-base md:text-lg">Imported recipes:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
        <li>Are not visible to other users</li>
        <li>Are not shared publicly in the app</li>
        <li>Are not added to a public recipe library</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        Think of your &ldquo;Favorites&rdquo; tab like your own personal recipe notebook.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        Every imported recipe remains private and tied to the user&rsquo;s personal account.{' '}
        <span className="font-semibold">All imported recipes are hyperlinked at every touchpoint</span> ‚Äî so anytime a user opens the
        imported recipe in the app, they&rsquo;ll see and be able to tap back to the original blog or post.

      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        We deeply value the work that goes into recipe creation. Healthy Kitchen is founded by a food creator ‚Äî someone who built a
        recipe blog that earns revenue through ads. So we get it. The last thing we&rsquo;d want is to undermine that.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        The Import feature is here to help users stay organized, reduce food stress, and simplify their lives ‚Äî not to take away from
        your work or revenue.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        In fact, we believe it actually helps: Imported recipes are linked directly to the original blog post or Instagram link,
        which means users <span className="font-semibold">must click back</span> to the source to view full instructions, photos, or
        additional details. That can lead to <span className="font-semibold">more visits</span>, not fewer.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        We also actively encourage our users to continue supporting their favorite food bloggers and creators by visiting the original
        websites whenever possible. All imported recipes are hyperlinked at every touch point the user who saves them will encounter
        them.

      {/* What‚Äôs a DMCA? */}
      <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-2 mb-2">What&rsquo;s a DMCA Policy?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        A <span className="font-semibold">DMCA Policy</span> is a standard legal policy that helps protect copyright holders. Under
        the <span className="font-semibold">Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</span>, online platforms like Healthy Kitchen
        are required to have a clear process for handling copyright infringement claims.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        If a creator believes someone has copied or shared their copyrighted work without permission, the DMCA gives them the right
        to request its removal. A DMCA policy outlines how they can submit that request, and how the platform will handle it.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-justify">
        This protects both the creator <em>and</em> the platform, while giving everyone a clear path to resolve any copyright
        concerns.
